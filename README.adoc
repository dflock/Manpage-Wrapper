# Manpage Wrapper
:author: Duncan Lock

Wraps both `tldr` & `man`. If there's a tldr page, it'll use your tldr client to display it, if not it'll offer to try `man` instead.

## Requirements

This requires some kind of tldr client, eg tealdear: See: https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer.

## Installation

```shell
$ sudo cp manpage-wrapper.sh /usr/bin/manpage-wrapper
$ alias man="manpage-wrapper"
```

## Usage

```shell
# Lookup something without a tldr page:
$ ./manpage-wrapper.sh look
Page look not found in cache
Try updating with `tldr --update`, or submit a pull request to:
https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr
Show manpage (y/n)?y
